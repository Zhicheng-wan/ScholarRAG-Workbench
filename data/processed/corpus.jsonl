We use HumanEval [37] for coding tasks, and Language Model Evaluation Harness [38] for others. Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [15], [39] contains 57 tasks, spanning STEM, social sciences, humanities, and other subjects. The difficulty ranges from elementary to professional levels. The breadth of the dataset tests model’s overall problem solving and knowledge ability. Commonsense Reasoning (CR) consists of 6 datasets: PIQA [40], HellaSwag [41], WinoGrande [42], ARC easy and challenge [43], and OpenBookQA [29]. These multi- choice tasks include carefully crafted riddles, puzzles, and scenarios designed to probe a model’s ability to leverage implicit knowledge, make logical inferences, and navigate the rules of physical and social worlds. World Knowledge (WK) includes NaturalQuestions [44] and TriviaQA [45]. Both tasks are designed to test model’s question-answering ability in closed book setting. The models are not provided documents that may contain information about the question, and it has to rely on information learnt or memorized in pre-training data. Reading Comprehension (RC) uses BoolQ [46] to test model’s open book comprehension ability. BoolQ is a question answering dataset for yes/no questions. Each example is a triplet of (question, passage, answer), with the title of the page as optional additional context. The model is required to answer the question based on the given context in passage. Math ability is evaluated with GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K) [47]. GSM8K contains 8,500 grade school math problems. Both problems and answers are provided in natural language. These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, which is ideal for testing basic multi-step reasoning ability. Code evaluation uses HumanEval [37] dataset including 164 programming problems with a function signature, docstring, body, and several unit tests. They were handwritten to ensure not present in the training set of the models. A.

We also report an average score over all tasks in the last column. HLAT-7B performs better than OpenLLaMA-1 and is on- par with OpenLLaMA-2. Both HLAT-7B and OpenLLaMA models have some gap with LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2, which is likely due to the training data quality. Even though the data composition of RedPajama-1T is similar as those used in LLaMA-1, the data cleaning pipeline and final data quality are different, which therefore affects the model performance [48]. For HLAT-70B, we use the same training dataset as the 7B model for consistency. Although there is no OpenLLaMA baseline for a fair comparison, HLAT-70B performs better than LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 models of smaller sizes. The model performance gap with LLaMA-1 (65B) and LLaMA-2 (70B) is also smaller than those on 7B models. We acknowl- edge the lack of effort on data quality improvement, but our main goal is to showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of AWS TRAINIUM. On MMLU (5-shot), both HLAT models perform better than OpenLLaMA-1 and LLaMA-1 models of similar size. The performance is slightly worse than LLaMA-2 family of models, likely due to the difference in training dataset size and composition [8]. On Commonsense Reasoning (0-shot) and World Knowl- edge (5-shot), HLAT-7B performs similar to OpenLLaMA-1 and OpenLLaMA-2 models. By diving deep into performance on each individual task, HLAT-7B excels in 19/29 tasks as compared with OpenLLaMA-1, and 15/29 tasks compared with OpenLLaMA-2. Both HLAT and OpenLLaMA models have some gaps with LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 models, which may be due to the training set quality. Nevertheless, the gap (∼3%) is consistent on 7B and 70B models. On Math problems (GSM8K, 8-shot), HLAT-7B performs significantly better than OpenLLaMA-1 and OpenLLaMA-2. As will be discussed in the next section, HLAT-70B has a big improvement of Math ability in later training stage. HLAT- 70B performs similar as LLaMA1-65B, and we observed significant improvement in upsampling training stage. On Coding problems, both HLAT-7B and HLAT-70B perform comparable with LLaMA-1.

First, for OpenLLaMA-1, the tokenizer merges consecutive spaces which negatively affects the coding performance, as it eliminates important information such as indentation and line breaks. This issue is subsequently fixed in OpenLLaMA-2, which explains its better performance. Besides, OpenLLaMA-2 is trained with additional code data from StarCoder which also contributes to performance im- provement. B. Intermediate Model Performance During the model training, we also evaluate the intermediate checkpoints about every 200 billion tokens. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the model performance of HLAT-7B and HLAT-70B with respect to number of seen training tokens (in billions), respectively. On most benchmarks, the performance improves steadily, and correlates with the training loss. We found that for different tasks, the model converges at different rates. For Commonsense Reasoning, the model accuracy improves quickly at beginning of training, and starts to saturate at later training stages. This is similar as the trends observed in other LLM model trainings [8], [49]. However, for Math task (GSM8K) shown in Figure 3e, the learning curve shows an exponentially increasing trend. It increase very gradually for the initial ∼1 trillion tokens and begins to improve significantly during the later stages of training. Intuitively, this seems to indicate that the model is able to grasp more logical abilities after entering a relatively stable training plateau. We defer further research into this behavior as a future work. For World Knowledge task shown in Figure 3c, the per- formance increases almost linearly with number of training tokens. Since this is a closed book test and mainly evaluates the model’s ability of memorizing facts in pre-training data, the model seems to consistently improve its ability on this domain with more training steps and epochs. In addition, we tested if the trending is related to number of shots used in evaluation. It turns out that the trends are very similar for zero-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot tests. 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 25 30 35 40 45 Accuracy (norm) MMLU (a) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 50 52 54 56 58 60 Accuracy (norm) Commonsense Reasoning (b) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Exact match World Knowledge 0 shots 3 shots 5 shots (c) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 55.0 57.5 60.0 62.5 65.0 67.5 70.0 72.5 Accuracy BoolQ (d) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 2 4 6 8 10 Accuracy GSM8K (e) 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 Tokens (in Billions) 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Percentage Code pass@1 pass@10 pass@100 (f) Fig. 3: Intermediate model performance with number", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 512, "sha256": "e73cb464adeaf1fc0a25a88e8ec0a68dbd5f59bd15a217af33fa8f0378a3727b"}

Those observations indicate the necessity of a set of eval- uation tasks covering a wide range of domains for LLM pre-training. A single validation set or evaluation tasks from narrow domains may not fully reflect the actual over- or under- fitting of the model for general downstream performance. C. Upsampling During HLAT-70B training, we upsampled the training dataset in last 400B tokens. Specifically, we use 35.47% web data, 41.27% math data, and 23.26% coding data with more details listed in Table III. In Figure 4, we plot the evalua- tion performance of HLAT-70B with seen training tokens. In upsampling training stage, that is, after 1400B tokens, TABLE III: Upsampling dataset composition for HLAT-70B.

It improved math by 10% and coding by 5%. This is consistent with the findings in LLaMA-3 [10], where the researchers found significant improvement of LLaMA-3 8B model on math problems. However, they mentioned such method did not help much for 405B models. Our experiment fills the model size gap, and shows that upsampling still helps for a 70B model. D. Checkpoint Averaging For HLAT-70B, we average the last two checkpoints used in pre-training to generate a checkpoint for final evaluation [10], [33]. Table IV compares the individual checkpoints with 1740B training tokens and 1800B training tokens, as well as the averaged checkpoints. The averaged checkpoints outperforms individual checkpoints on average performance, as well as some individual tasks. TABLE IV: Evaluation of HLAT-70B with individual and averaged checkpoints.

Truthfulness and Bias We report the model’s truthfulness and bias using Truth- fulQA [50] and CrowS-pairs [51]. TruthfulQA presents a collection of meticulously crafted questions spanning diverse domains such as health, law, finance, and even politics. These queries deliberately target areas where human intuition and personal biases can lead to incorrect responses, and measure an LLM’s resistance to misinformed or erroneous knowledge. CrowS-Pairs is a benchmark designed to probe LLMs for social biases across nine categories, including gender, reli- gion, race/color, sexual orientation, age, nationality, disability, physical appearance and socioeconomic status. Each example is composed of a stereotype and an anti-stereotype. TABLE V: Model Truthfulness and Bias evaluation. CrowS- pairs (CSP) uses percentage of stereotypes as metric and TruthfulQA (TQA) uses multiple choice accuracy as metric.

For TruthfulQA, we measure the multiple-choice score, and higher score shows better truthfulness. For CrowS-Pairs, it measures the percentage of models choosing answers of stereotypes, so lower scores indicates smaller bias. Overall, HLAT performs similar to other open-source models. F. Efficiency and Scalability We describe the training efficiency in terms of Cost per 4-million tokens (CPT) and scalability reported in [52]. The CPT is defined as CPT = C T ×3600 × 4e6, where C is instance cost per hour ($21.50 for Trainium, and $32.77 for GPU), T is training throughput (tokens per second). CPT quantifies both the training speed and also hardware cost. We use this metric to compare training efficiency of Trainium and GPU. 4 8 16 32 64 Number of nodes 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Normalized CPT trn1, 7B p4d, 7B trn1, 70B p4d, 70B Fig. 5: Normalized cost per 4 million tokens (CPT) for 7B and 70B models on AWS TRAINIUM with various number of nodes.

Fig- ure 5 plots the normalized CPT of training on TRAINIUM and scaling. The TRAINIUM CPT is normalized, such that the CPT of the GPU baseline (p4d, 7B) on 4 nodes is 100%. Overall, the training cost on trn1 is approximately 60% of GPU, and is consistent with the number of nodes. In addition, the CPTs on 70B models are roughly 10 times of those on 7B models. G. Model Limitation We note some limitations of HLAT in this section. Similar as other LLMs, HLAT suffers a set of limitations such as hallucinations, potential non-factual generations, biases, and toxicity [53]. For example, although comparable with other open-source pre-trained models, the bias of HLAT is still relative high on some subjects such as sexual orientation, physical appearance, religion, and socioeconomic (see Table V). This is partially due to the usage of publicly available datasets. More importantly, as a pre-trained model, HLAT has not gone through a supervised finetuning and human prefer- ence alignment. Those fine-tuning methods have been shown to be able to alleviate some limitations of pre-trained LLMs [9]. Another limitation is that our training is stopped after 1.8 trillion tokens. As is suggested by LLaMA-3 [10], HLAT may be able to further improve on certain tasks, such as math, world knowledge, MMLU, and coding, with more training tokens. VI. BEST PRACTICES & FUTURE DIRECTIONS In this section, we share some best practices we observed for training on AWS TRAINIUM, and raise open questions for future research. Parallelism: NxDT supports TP up to 32 degrees and pipeline parallelism. For a 7B model, we found that the combination of TP=8 and PP=1 provides the highest training throughput, but not for HLAT-70B. So the optimal parallelism configuration varies with model sizes and architectures. To achieve the highest training throughput, parallelism configu- ration needs to be jointly optimized with choice of activation checkpointing method, gradient accumulation steps, and train- ing precision, to balance memory and communication costs. Training Precision: NxDT supports various training pre- cision configurations, including full precision (FP32), BF16 with and without SR, standard mixed precision training, etc. Full precision training is often memory-wise infeasible for multi-billion LLMs. We compared multiple training strategies for HLAT: pure BF16, BF16 with SR and standard mixed precision training. Empirically, we found that training loss of pure BF16 diverges. BF16 with SR shows similar training loss as mixed precision on HLAT-7B model, but converges slower on HLAT-70B. We finally chose BF16 with SR for higher throughput on HLAT-7B, but standard mixed precision on HLAT-70B. For models of other sizes and architecture, warm-up study may be needed", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 512, "sha256": "2f5e409cfd33be307785bce29ac7af9f1d41871bbc242b54daeb78df32791f87"}
{"doc_id": "arxiv:2404.10630#model:part-6", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10630", "anchor": "#model:part-6", "type": "paper", "title": "", "section": "Model", "text": "often memory-wise infeasible for multi-billion LLMs. We compared multiple training strategies for HLAT: pure BF16, BF16 with SR and standard mixed precision training. Empirically, we found that training loss of pure BF16 diverges. BF16 with SR shows similar training loss as mixed precision on HLAT-7B model, but converges slower on HLAT-70B. We finally chose BF16 with SR for higher throughput on HLAT-7B, but standard mixed precision on HLAT-70B. For models of other sizes and architecture, warm-up study may be needed to decide the optimal training precision. Usually, the divergence can be observed in first few thousands of steps. Choice of β2: We observed that using β2 = 0.99 causes training instability and slower convergence. This is related to the choice of BF16 with SR training precision. A large β2 fails to capture the gradient explosion at current and recent steps, and hence does not effectively reduce the gradients in occurrence of gradient explosion. Switching to β2 = 0.95 addresses the above-mentioned problem. Weight decay: We applied weight decay to all layers. Empirically, weight decay is not applied to normalization and bias layers [54]. In our experiment, we did not found much performance-wise difference of those two methods. Pre-compilation: TRAINIUM requires pre-compiling the scripts to graphs. The compilation takes some time, especially for large models. Debugging on training scripts (e.g., printing out intermediate tensors) may require re-compilation. Instead of directly developing on a large model, we found it more efficient to develop and test on a smaller model and scale up afterwards. VII. RELATED WORK LLM pre-training: After the Transformer architecture [1] was introduced, BERT [54] was proposed to pre-train a language model on a large corpus of unlabeled data. Fol- lowing the success of BERT model on various NLP tasks, many pre-trained language models are later introduced with different architectures and training methods, such as GPT-2 [55], RoBERTa [56], BART [57], and so on [6]. Studies later observed significant performance improvement of language models by increasing model size and training data [58]. Such abilities are further demonstrated in LLMs such as GPT-3 [7], PaLM [59], LLaMA [8]–[10], Falcon [60], Gemini [61], Phi [48], etc. Pre-trained on trillions of tokens, LLMs with tens or hundreds of billions parameters show remarkable ability in generating creative text contents, as well as a variety of downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, machine translation, programming, etc. [6]. AI accelerators: Most models are trained on NVIDIA GPU accelerators, such as GPT [7], [62] and LLaMA [8], [9]. Falcon-180B [60] was trained on AWS SageMaker, with up to 4,096 A100 40GB GPUs using p4d instances. However, the landscape of hardware accelerators for deep learning train- ing has blossomed in recent years, with established players like NVIDIA GPUs facing fierce competition from custom offerings like Google’s TPU and AWS TRAINIUM. PaLM- 2 [59] and OpenLLaMA [29] have demonstreated successful LLM pre-training on Google TPU. Recently, OLMo [49] is an open-source model developed by AI2.

While RAG can enhance the quality (accuracy and relevance) of LLM-generated responses [7, 53, 58, 91, 96], RAG queries are inherently slow as they need more compute and mem- ory resources to process the long input context to answer a query [6, 15, 42]. Thus, it is essential to balance high response quality and low response delays in RAG inference systems. 1RAG vs. long-context models is an active field of research, with the industry widely deploying RAG for its task-focused model inference quality and better resource-sharing capabilities [68]. 2Though RAG sometimes refers to the retrieval step, in this work, a RAG system includes both retrieval and LLM inference based on the retrieved texts, and we aim to optimize the whole pipeline. Past research efforts have optimized RAG, regarding ei- ther response quality or response delay, but they fall short in optimizing the quality-delay tradeoffs of RAG. RAG queries have an associated RAG configuration which de- scribes how and how much data to input for the query (more in §2) [72, 79, 83]. One line of prior work focuses on reducing response delay through better query schedul- ing (e.g., GPU allocation and inference batching) for RAG queries [2, 44, 45, 70, 76], without adapting the RAG con- figuration themselves. An alternate line of work focuses on maximizing generation quality by tuning the configurations of RAG queries [32, 77, 83], but this is often done at the cost of longer response delay. The RAG configuration simultaneously affects generation quality and response delay (e.g., retrieving too many chunks for a simple RAG query may unnecessarily inflate delay with- out increasing quality). Unlike traditional data queries (e.g., SQL) which specify the inputs and operators, RAG queries are inherently under-specified as they consist of a text query written in natural language [27, 32, 57, 64] and do not directly specify the exact RAG configuration of its execution. Moreover, multiple configuration knobs can influence the delay-quality tradeoffs. For instance, besides how many chunks to retrieve, how to use them in the LLM’s input involves two design choices—should the chunks be processed by the LLM jointly, or should the chunks be summarized first before being fed into the LLM together (and how long should a summary be). Recent works also attempt to tune RAG con- figuration [32, 77], but they focus on either tuning individual knobs or maximizing quality at the cost of higher delay. How- ever, tuning configurations across multiple knobs quickly hits a prohibitive combinatorial space (more in §3) and re- quires optimizations to reduce the search cost. What’s more, the RAG configuration should be tuned jointly with scheduling. Consider two configurations: 𝐴feeds all retrieved text chunks in one LLM input, and 𝐵summarizes first each chunk with an LLM and then feeds the summaries 1 arXiv:2412.10543v2 [cs.LG]", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 512, "sha256": "d9142e9627112b69af8cb5f22978e474158cd1ffcbf75d2f7635604ecdc58a0b"}

While 𝐴(which calls the LLM once) is seemingly faster than 𝐵(which calls the LLM multiple times), 𝐴could be slower as it requires more GPU memory than 𝐵and thus could be delayed in the sched- uler queue. Without making batching and configuration se- lection jointly, it would be difficult to avoid such pitfalls. Finally, the impact of RAG configurations on quality-delay tradeoffs also varies significantly with queries. For example, to answer “In which country is the Kimbrough Memorial Sta- dium located?”, the RAG may retrieve and analyze one text chunk about the stadium. In contrast, to answer “Compare NVIDIA’s operating cost over the first three quarters of 2024 and identify the highest one”, the RAG may need multiple chunks, each containing the quarter’s operating cost, and process these chunks jointly, instead of reading them separately. The above examples illustrate queries differ in complexity (more in §4), leading to needing different configurations per-query for optimal quality-delay tradeoffs. Empirically, we show that picking RAG configuration per-query achieves 12 −15% higher quality and 2.5 −3× lower delay than using any fixed configuration across all queries in a dataset (§5). Thus, RAG configurations should be adapted on a per-query basis. Yet, existing RAG systems, which hand-pick a static config- uration offline based on a few example queries [1, 21, 39, 85], lose out on quality or response time. This paper presents METIS, the first RAG system that adapts multiple configuration knobs on a per-query basis and jointly makes configuration selections and scheduling decisions (i.e., which LLM inference in a batch) to optimize the delay-quality tradeoffs for RAG. As this would require solving a joint combinatorial prob- lem for every query, which can be prohibitively expensive (§3), METIS tackles the challenge with a two-step approach. First, METIS prunes the massive configuration space for each received query to a smaller yet promising one that con- tains configurations that likely yield high-quality output for the given query. Specifically, METIS uses a separate LLM to estimate the query’s profile, including how many pieces of information are required to answer the query and whether joint reasoning is likely required across these pieces of in- formation (more in §4.1). The intuition of the query profiles is that they can effectively filter out undesirable RAG config- urations.

It should be noted that the LLM-based profiler is an extra overhead in METIS, but fortunately, its input only contains the RAG query itself and the metadata of the RAG database, which are orders of magnitude shorter than the long contexts in RAG, so the estimation can be relatively fast, about 1/10 of the delay of the execution of the RAG query.

Performance of METIS on the KG RAG FinSec [50] dataset compared to the baselines. Full results shown in §7. Using the narrowed configuration space, METIS reduces the RAG response delays by jointly deciding the per-query configuration and query scheduling based on available re- sources (§4.3). The insight is that within the pruned configu- ration space, the scheduler can make optimal configuration decisions without exploring the original, large configuration space and the implications on quality. In short, METIS’s two-level design loosely decouples the problem into (1) pruning configuration space to a smaller yet promising range of configurations, which focuses solely on keeping the accuracy high, and (2) jointly optimizing configuration (within the narrowed range) and scheduling to optimize response delay by choosing configurations which best-fit into the GPU memory. We evaluate METIS across four RAG datasets with diverse query profiles (e.g., reasoning vs. domain-specific QA). Fig- ure 1 shows a preview of our results. Our key takeaways are as follows. When achieving the same or higher quality than the baselines, METIS reduces the response delay by 1.6−2.8× compared to the latest vLLM (a state-of-the-art serving en- gine), Parrot (the latest LLM query-scheduling method), as well as AdaptiveRAG (the latest RAG configuration-tuning method). METIS also achieves 1.8 −4.5× higher through- put compared to these baselines when achieving the same response delay and same/higher quality. The general concept of using LLMs to guide system tuning is not exactly new [60, 88], but our key contribution lies in applying the concept to RAG systems, through joint sched- uling with resource-aware configuration selection, leading to significantly better resource sharing (§4.2, §4.3). 2 RAG systems and configurations As an LLM often does not have domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge, LLM applications commonly employ RAG to sup- plement LLM inference with external knowledge to generate high-quality responses.

Despite the growth of model context length, using RAG to pinpoint the relevant context is still significantly cheaper in terms of resource cost (GPU require- ment), latency, and memory consumption (KV Cache size). For 2 general-purpose QA pipelines, RAG is cost-efficient with re- trieving targeted chunks based on semantic similarity to the query. Using LLMs with long-context documents in contrast has much higher GPU memory usage and delay [43, 45, 71]. Before processing queries, a RAG system organizes back- ground documents by splitting them into chunks (each with a fixed number of tokens), embedding each chunk using models like Bert [12, 19], and storing the embeddings with the chunks in a vector database. Processing a RAG query involves two main steps: • Retrieval: The RAG system retrieves one or more rele- vant context chunks from the database by comparing the query’s embedding, (using the same embedding model as for database indexing), with the stored embeddings. • Synthesis: After retrieving the relevant chunks, the RAG system combines these chunks and the RAG query to form a single/multiple LLM call(s) to generate the response. Retrieval is computationally lightweight and much faster than synthesis (> 100×), so the response delay is typically dominated by the synthesis step [90]. RAG configuration: This work focuses on optimizing three configuration knobs, illustrated in Figure 2, which are de- rived from key design questions that affect RAG performance in terms of response delay and quality: • How many chunks to retrieve (num_chunks): The number of context chunks directly affects the delay of the synthesis step, with more computation needed to process the longer sequences with more chunks. In the meantime, retrieving too few chunks risks low response quality if the retrieved chunks do not contain enough useful information. • How to synthesize (synthesis_method): If the LLM should read the chunks separately, RAG uses the LLM to generate one answer for the query using each chunk separately and picks the output with the highest confidence, which is called map_rerank. This often incurs the least compu- tation but can cause low quality if the useful information is scattered in different chunks, in which case the LLM should read the chunks jointly. The RAG system can feed these chunks in the LLM input directly by concatenating them within a single prompt (called stuff) or to create a shorter summary for each chunk first before feeding the summaries and the query into the LLM to generate the final response (called map_reduce). stuff needs less computa- tion than map_reduce, but risks degraded output quality for long inputs due to the lost-in-the-middle problem [47]. • How long is each summary (intermediate_length): Fi- nally, if the LLM produces the summary for each chunk based on the user query, the length of each summary greatly affects the quality and response of map_reduce— shorter", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 512, "sha256": "3b568ece8ef08daa463a1d90b44e98742e87a8d6b61869bc8b9e9d5ef7a30a9d"}

Illustration of different RAG synthesis methods, which have various LLM reasoning capabilities. In this work, while we focus on universal RAG knobs which affect quality and delay common to all RAG systems, METIS can be extended to other tunable knobs (e.g., some RAG system may dynamically choose the embedding model, retrieval index or serving LLM). METIS’ design is extensible to any RAG configuration knob based on the query profile. Performance metrics: We evaluate the performance of a RAG system using two metrics: • Response quality calculates the F1 score of the generated response against the ground truth. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision (# correctly generated words) and recall (# of correct words successfully generated). This metric is widely used in prior works [10, 69, 72]. • Response delay measures the time elapsed from when the RAG system receives a RAG request to when it completes generating the response. Next, we show that these knobs need to be properly tuned on a per-query basis to achieve optimal tradeoff between quality and delay in §3. 3 Towards better quality-delay tradeoffs Prior work on RAG either optimizes for lower delay or higher quality, i.e., the first picks static configurations and focuses on reducing the delay by smart scheduling and resource allo- cation [44, 70, 76] and the second picks RAG configurations to maximize quality without regard to resource usage or delay [32, 77, 83].

Varying each RAG configuration knob leads to different quality-latency tradeoffs, and these tradeoffs differ across queries (Q1 in green, Q2 in blue, and Q3 in red). To improve the delay-quality tradeoff, our insight is that quality and delay should jointly be optimized in this large tradeoff space created by the choice of RAG configuration knobs. Importantly, the configurations with better quality- delay tradeoffs vary significantly across queries. To showcase this observation, we use three queries from Musique [78], a popular reasoning QA dataset (§7.1). • Q1: “In what county was William W. Blair’s born?” • Q2: “Are Alison Skipper, Diane Gilliam Fisher, and Rachel McAdams from the same country?” • Q3: “When and why did the Voyager 1, the spacecraft that detected storms on Neptune, leave our solar system?” We chose queries with different natural language complexity and reasoning, Q1 being relatively less complex than Q2 and Q3. Then, we adjust the value of each configuration knob in order to quantify each knob’s impact on the quality- delay tradeoffs in each of the queries. Impact of synthesis method: Figure 4 (a) changes the syn- thesis method and shows its effect on the quality-delay trade- off, while keeping the other RAG configuration knobs con- stant. We vary the synthesis method as map_rerank, stuff, and map_reduce from left to right. The insight is that the optimal synthesis method that strikes the best quality-delay tradeoff (closest to the top left corner) differs significantly across the different queries. For simple queries like Q1 (green), quality plateaus for more complex synthesis methods (stuff and map_reduce). Because it only needs a single piece of context, map_rerank which processes chunks in isolation suffices, whereas cross- chunk reasoning (stuff and map_reduce) adds undue delay (2×) without improving quality. For queries such as Q2 (blue) that require cross-chunk rea- soning, stuff and map_reduce provide significant quality improvements (35% increase) by processing chunks jointly. For more complex queries, such as Q3 (red), which require even more reasoning and information (why Voyager 1 left has multiple reasons), methods like map_reduce improve quality (30% increase) by removing unnecessary text in the mapper phase, to help the LLM focus on the relevant content. Impact of the number of retrieved chunks: Figure 4 (b) fixes the synthesis method (stuff) and shows the impact of the number of retrieved chunks (1-35) on quality and delay. Simple queries, like Q1 (green), can often be answered using just one or two chunks (needs only birth county).

For more complex queries, Q2 (blue) and Q3 (red), increasing the number of chunks (1-15) improves the likelihood of retriev- ing all relevant context and improves quality. Blindly retrieving more chunks than necessary risks di- luting the relevance of actual important information, due to commonly known problems such as “lost-in-the-middle” [28, 47]. In all three queries, retrieving more chunks beyond a point harms the quality (up to 20% drop) and unnecessar- ily inflates delay (up to 3×). Hence we have a quality-delay tradeoff where increasing chunks up to a point helps quality but beyond that it increases delay while degrading quality. Impact of the intermediate output length: Figure 4 (c) shows the impact of our third configuration knob, vary- ing the intermediate output length (1-100) for map_reduce synthesis methods on the quality-delay tradeoff. For simple queries like Q1 (green), short amounts of intermediate length are enough to answer the query (10-20 words). For more com- plex queries Q2 (blue) and Q3 (red), increasing the amount of intermediate length (70-100 words) provided helps the model with enough information to answer the query. Overall, we see that RAG queries naturally vary in com- plexity, requiring differing levels of inter-chunk reasoning and varying numbers of context chunks. More complex queries, which require more reasoning and context, ben- efit from increased LLM computation, which can come at the cost of increased delay. Adding more context chunks helps to a point beyond which it harms the output quality and delay. Thus, adapting RAG configuration on a per-query basis is crucial. Figures 2, 3, 4 illustrate tuning most popular RAG configuration knobs, however the tuning extends to more RAG configurations with richer tradeoff spaces (§4.2). 4 Pareto Boundary of fixed configuration with vLLM Pareto Boundary of fixed configuration with vLLM Per-Query Configuration Per-Query Configuration Figure 5. Per-query configuration can achieve significantly better quality-delay tradeoffs across queries compared to every fixed configuration choice. Figure 5 uses queries from two datasets (Musique and QM- SUM, see §7.1) and shows that picking the best configuration for each query (the best configuration is the one with the lowest delay that achieves less than 2% drop than the highest achievable quality) achieves superior quality-delay tradeoff than picking any static configuration for all queries. Choos- ing the configuration per-query allows up to 3× delay saving compared to static configurations which are the closest in quality. Every single static configuration choice that achieves comparable delay has at least a 10% quality drop.

Each RAG query comes in plain text with practically no associated RAG configurations. Moreover, the space of configurations grows exponentially with multiple knobs. For example, for a map_reduce configuration, with 30 values for num_chunks and 50 values for intermediate_length leads to 1500 configurations for a query. Exhaustively profiling all configurations per-query and choosing the best is infeasible. Alternatively, if we profile periodically, we lose out on the potential configuration selection for each query, as variance in query profile leads to different quality-delay tradeoffs. Pro- filing cost is also prohibitively expensive as the LLM needs to be run with many synthesis methods, number of chunks etc., which require high GPU usage. Additionally, the delay of profiling can be ∼100× the inference delay due to multiple LLM calls during profiling. Online RAG queries have strin- gent requirements for GPU resource usage and end-to-end delay [70, 76]. This makes it hard to systematically decide what an optimal per-input configuration should be. To truly achieve the benefit of per-query configuration adaptation, we need a smart system to drastically reduce to a useful configuration space, in a fast and cheap manner. 4 METIS: Enabling per-query configuration adaptation for RAG We present METIS, a novel system for serving RAG queries focusing on high generation quality and minimal delay. METIS is a RAG controller (Figure 6) with two main components: Configuration Space Pruning (§ 4.1, 4.2 ) Joint scheduler (§ 4.3) RAG Queries Vector Database GPU Memory Serving LLM RAG Configs Text Chunks Check Resource Status Generated Output Retriever RAG Synthesis Chosen Config Figure 6. METIS consists of a RAG controller which per- forms configuration space pruning and joint scheduling. • Pruning configuration space: We estimate each query’s pro- file (§4.1) and reduce the RAG configuration space to a smaller yet promising one that still yields high generation quality (§4.2) (leading to a 50-100× reduction). • RAG scheduler: Within the pruned configuration space for the query, METIS’ scheduler chooses the best config- uration for the query to achieve the best quality-latency trade-off based on the available system resources (§4.3). Once the configuration is chosen, the METIS’ executes the query using the chosen configuration—retrieving the selected number of chunks and uses the selected synthesis method to feed into the LLM’s input. 4.1 Estimating a query’s profile Query profile: To choose the correct RAG configurations, the first step of METIS is to create the profile of the query (as we see in Figure 7) by querying an LLM (we call this LLM query profiler).

METIS RAG configuration selection workflow. • The length of the summarization: If the query is complex and needs a lot of different information, it is often neces- sary to first summarize the relevant information chunks first (to reduce the noise inside these chunks) and then gen- erate the final answer from these summaries. The output for this dimension is a number from 30-200. METIS is not the first to use query profile as a metric for deciding RAG configurations, it extends upon methods like AdaptiveRAG [32] which have used LLM’s to estimate query profile but they only focus on one dimension (the number of chunks to retrieve). In Section 7, we show the impact of each dimension on the overall improvement. Why the query profile could be estimated: Estimating the aforementioned query profile is feasible, not only be- cause of the reasoning power of LLMs3 in analyzing natural language queries, but also because we provide sufficient in- formation to the LLM-based profiler. METIS feeds the profile estimator with not only the query, but also a metadata of the database that contains the background document. The metadata is a short description about the type of con- tent in the database and its data size (chunk_size). Specif- ically, we use a single-line summaries already attached to the original source datasets as the metadata of the dataset. For example, the metadata for the KG RAG Finsec’s database [50] contains quarterly financial reports and questions of Fortune 500 companies with a chunk_size of 1000. It de- scribes the content topics of the chunks with information such as revenue growth indicators, product release informa- tion, sales etc.,. When presented with a query on financials of such a company, the LLM can use the metadata to decide questions like how much to summarize/how much reasoning is required. We give details on the prompt and the intuition to generate metadata for new datasets in Appendix §A. It is important to acknowledge that for highly under- specified queries, it is hard for any model (even human) to reasonably estimate the query’s profile. For an example 3We have tested both GPT and Llama models as the profile query-profiler, and they yield similarly impressive results (§7). query “Compare current US Stock Market trends,” the query profile here does not provide enough information (e.g., how many years should the trend be derived from). To answer such highly under-specified queries, more information about the dataset will unlikely help.4 Moreover, we observed that extra information does not significantly improve the profiler’s estimates. For instance, in theory, it helps to know the embedding algorithm used by RAG. Yet, the embedding models perform similarly overall across queries and datasets under our consideration.

How we map and why the profile helps: To understand the role of query profiles, consider the following examples: • “Who is the current CEO of NVIDIA?” This query is not complex and does not require joint reasoning. Due to the query being simple with no reasoning required and one piece of information (name of CEO). • “Which month had the highest NVIDIA’s stock price the six months from January to June 2024?” This query is simple but still needs to read information jointly, specifically six pieces of information (stock price for every month) • “What are the reasons for NVIDIA’s month-on-month stock price change from January to June 2024” This query is complex and needs to read multiple pieces of information jointly (stock prices, reasons for change etc.) As multiple reasons need to be analyzed here, summarizing all of the in- formation first helps narrow down to relevant information and perform clearer reasoning (why the prices changed). 4Maybe some chat history from the same user will help, but that is beyond the scope of this work. 6 Algorithm 1: Rule based mapping algorithm Input: Query complexity, Joint reasoning required Input: Pieces of information , Summarization length range Result: synthesis_method, num_chunks, intermediate_length 1 if Joint reasoning required == “no” then 2 synthesis_method = map_rerank 3 else 4 if Query complexity == “low” then 5 synthesis_method = stuff 6 else 7 synthesis_method = stuff, map_reduce 8 num_chunks = [Pieces of information , 3× Pieces of information] 9 intermediate_length_range = Summarization length range Algorithm 1 outlines the rule-based mapping process. This mapping is significantly helpful, it improves upon raw pro- filer outputs and converts them to usable RAG configurations. It reduces the cost of the profiler LLM by restricting it to provide short binary decisions only. We decide the range of synthesis_method selections based on two of the profile dimensions estimated in §4.1, i.e., the “Query complexity” and the “Joint reasoning require- ment”. Simple queries that don’t need any reasoning can an- swered with map_rerank while queries that require joint rea- soning need stuff or map_reduce. We then decide the range of values for num_chunks based on the profile dimension of the “Pieces of information required”, i.e., 𝑛—specifically, we set the range of num_chunks to be 1−3 times of 𝑛. We do not directly set num_chunks at𝑛, because it (1) gives some leeway for the retrieval logic (e.g., typically Bert-embedding-based)5 to find necessary information, and (2) provides the room for the scheduler to select the configuration that fits in available", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 512, "sha256": "f265b10e1abcb4c9a7843379ed75bc814f64bf8bb91b83c17d0688ba17448d1d"}

Finally, we get the intermediate_length range from the “summary length” estimate, which is already a value range (derived from the query, metadata and chunk size). Algorithm 1 is central to METIS’ design to reduce to the space to our useful RAG configurations and this is extendable to other RAG configurations. For instance, a particular RAG pipeline might use an external re-ranker [23, 52], query re- writer [36, 51] or perform an external web-search [73] along with database retrieval. The mapping algorithm can map the profiling LLM’s output (e.g., of Query complexity) and be used to guide such decisions for these newer RAG configurations. Additionally, such mapping algorithms greatly reduce the overall inference cost of RAG inference. Attempting to use 5A typical RAG retriever these days will have to retrieve 2-3× more chunks than minimally required to provide sufficient information for the LLM inference [24, 55].

METIS joint schedules RAG configurations with available GPU memory (chosen example - map_reduce) the LLM profiler to directly provide the exact RAG configu- ration values does not work. For this, the LLM needs to be regularly retrained for this task to adapt to new configura- tions and will require significantly greater system resources (e.g., GPUs blocked for this). In contrast, METIS uses the LLM to only analyze natural language properties and provide bi- nary decisions, which the mapping algorithm translates to useful configurations with a significantly lower cost. It is important to note that the concept of METIS belongs to an active research trend in the ML and systems community that leverages LLM outputs and mapping functions to guide real system decisions and optimizations, an example of which is LLM routing [13, 31, 56, 59]. While current LLM routers use trained LLMs to map decisions from query complexity to only choose from families of inference models (outside the realm of RAG), we differ by mapping the output to the configuration knob we run for the RAG queries.

While it demonstrates remarkable improvement in practice, more work will be needed to complement it for better interpretability and robustness. 4.3 Joint configuration-scheduling adaptation Once provided with the narrowed range of each RAG con- figuration knob (synthesis_method, num_chunks and intermediate_length), we need to choose a RAG configu- ration, which is aware of the current system resource (GPU memory). If we pick configurations which do not fit in cur- rent memory, it will lead to additional queuing delay waiting for the GPU memory to free up. We have METIS’s pruned configuration space where the quality is high, we now focus on choosing the best configu- ration which fits in memory, without focusing on quality. 7 Why we need to choose the scheduling jointly: We motivate the need for joint scheduling along with the RAG configuration choice in Figure 8. Consider a setup where we tune only one RAG configura- tion knob of synthesis_method. Other knobs num_chunks and intermediate_length are fixed at 20 and 100 respec- tively. Let’s assume both stuff and map_reduce are present in the pruned space. For the scheduling knob, we consider the amount of GPU memory available for the current batch. Consider a baseline system which separates the joint de- cision from the scheduling and picks only the RAG con- figuration knob (synthesis_method). It chooses the stuff configuration knob as it has lower compute requirement, so given enough memory it should be fast. The baseline system in Figure 8 (a) does not consider other jobs in the system and does not evaluate the amount of available resource to make its scheduling decision. Due to its long input length with 20 chunks, stuff turns out to be memory-intensive. If the available GPU memory is low, stuff doesn’t fit in memory and needs to be queued. This ends up with stuff being slow. Jointly considering the available GPU memory with choos- ing the RAG configuration knob avoids this pitfall. For exam- ple, in Figure 8 (b), if the original configuration was stuff, METIS can choose to use map_reduce (based on the current GPU memory available). By doing so, METIS can start putting the mappers which fit in memory, into the current running_batch of requests which fits in the GPU. While map_reduce requires more compute, in this case, it benefits from being able to start execution much faster, as some of the mappers fit in memory. METIS does not need to wait for the GPU memory to free up and changes the configuration aware of system resource, to save delay and achieve a better quality-delay tradeoff.

METIS does not need to wait for the GPU memory to free up and changes the configuration aware of system resource, to save delay and achieve a better quality-delay tradeoff. Jointly choosing the configuration knobs: METIS first provides us with a pruned range of configurations. A straw- man solution is to pick a constant value from the across queries. (e.g., the median value of the num_chunks). While this is better than using one static configuration for all queries, it is still sub-optimal as it does not look at the current system resource availability. This prevents us from exploiting the best quality-delay tradeoff across RAG queries. We use a best-fit algorithm to allow for variation in config- urations across queries. We first compute the GPU memory requirement for the RAG query from the RAG configura- tion knobs (e.g., num_chunks) for every configuration in the pruned space. Then, we measure the current available mem- ory on the GPU to see what can fit into the current batch. We then pick the best configuration from the pruned space that fits into the GPU. METIS defines the best configuration as the one with overall highest memory requirement, from all which fit in memory. The insight here is that within the reduced range of good quality configurations, higher mem- ory configurations correspond to expensive configurations (e.g. more number of chunks, higher intermediate length). In general, these configurations should lead to slightly higher quality in the reduced space. For example, if the pruned space says num_chunks is 5-10 and the synthesis_method is stuff and both 5 or 6 chunks can fit in memory, we choose 6 chunks. We don’t pick a configuration that doesn’t fit in GPU, so we would never choose more than 6 chunks. If we do that, the system will queue the request inflating the delay. After choosing the configuration that fits into the current running_batch, the vLLM engine is optimized to perform chunked_prefill. However, even with chunked_prefill, it can only offload parts of long prefill of stuff requests which do not fit in the current batch and still inflates the queuing de- lay. Jointly scheduling RAG configurations enables efficient resource usage, which cannot be obtained by only relying on the output of the LLM profiler. What if none of the configurations fit in the GPU? A main insight for METIS’s design comes from the observation that in general, the RAG-specific focused configurations can be loosely-decoupled from the scheduling-specific configura- tions. METIS tries to fit the best possible configurations into GPU memory after it gets the profiler’s reduced configura- tion space. It can sometimes happen that the current GPU memory availability is too low and none of the profiler’s configurations fit in the currently available GPU.

It can sometimes happen that the current GPU memory availability is too low and none of the profiler’s configurations fit in the currently available GPU. One way we handle this is by falling back to a cheaper fixed configuration and choosing to ignore the output of the pruning. As we already have access to the query complexity profile and we can pick cheaper configurations, which would meet the requirement for the current query. For instance, if the query doesn’t require joint reason- ing, we can pick a map_rerank configuration with as many chunks that fit into the current GPU memory, ignoring the remaining pruned spaces. If joint reasoning is required, we pick a stuff or map_reduce configurations with the few chunks that fit into memory. We can choose which synthesis method to use once based on the exact memory availability. This allows loose-decoupling of the RAG configurations into a smaller space and then choosing configurations based on system resource availability. This also allows SLO-based constraints on RAG queries if certain queries have strict budgets on their generation latency. 5 Refinements to METIS In spite of it all, it is possible for the profiler to (sometimes) fail and in such cases, it is important to detect if METIS’s profiler fails on a query in a fast manner to prevent it from leading to bad RAG configurations. Also it is useful to decide how to provide feedback to METIS to improve. When is the quality profile reliable? METIS uses LLM to generate the quality profile. Inspired by recent work in use 8 Above threshold - 98% good profiles Above threshold - 96% good profiles 7% below threshold - 90% bad profiles 7% below threshold - 85% bad profiles 90% Threshold Figure 9. Confidence score threshold for different profiler outputs is used to decide when not to use the profiler output. of model confidence [20, 25, 84] as a quality metric, we use confidence scores for METIS’s LLM profiler as to measure the reliability of the profile provided. We obtain the confidence scores from the LLM’s log-probs values on the output (the logarithm of the confidence score, which is directly provided with the output with no extra overhead). We then threshold the confidence score using a confidence score threshold (90% across different datasets) to predict whether the quality profile derived from the quality profiler LLM is actually good (defined as whether the profile can lead to 10% increase in F1-score or 1.5 −2× reduction in delay or both) or not. Such 90% threshold can be tuned for better performance, and we leave it to future work. From Figure 9, we draw two conclusions. First, over 93% of the quality profiles derived from LLM are of high confidence (i.e., over 90%).

First, over 93% of the quality profiles derived from LLM are of high confidence (i.e., over 90%). Further, for those high-confidence profile, over 96% of them are good profiles, meaning that they can be used to improve quality, or reduce latency, or both. To handle those cases where the quality profile is of con- fidence score lower than 90% , METIS will fall back to the pruned configuration space of recent 10 queries. How to improve the profiler over time? METIS improves the query profiler LLM by profiling extra feedback prompt to this LLM. We generate this feedback prompt by generating the most accurate output, which is obtained by performing inference on the most resource-demanding configuration (the map_reduce configuration with a large number of input chunks (30) and a high value of intermediate length (300 tokens)) and then ask the quality profiler LLM what config- uration it should choose based on the query and the most accurate answer to that query. The key insight is that, the most accurate answer to the query provides the quality profiler LLM extra knowledge and thus can be used to further improve its decision. To control the cost of generating feedback prompts, METIS only generates the feedback prompt once every 30 queries and we only keep the last four feedback prompts.

Input and output length (# of tokens) distributions of the RAG datasets used in our evaluation. (7B parameters). Using this has minimal cost, as METIS only runs it on the query itself and in METIS as the query is at least 100× shorter than the context. Using this approach, METIS still saves cost as opposed to using a large LLM for inference (as shown in Section 7). We also show that METIS can use different closed and open-source LLMs as the profiler LLM for pruning and can still provide impressive delay reduction without hurting the accuracy in Section 7. 6 Implementation We implement METIS in about 2K lines of code in Python on top of the state-of-the-art popular LLM serving engine vLLM [41].

This dataset contains multiple meeting transcripts and queries to summarize relevant spans of meetings. We build a retrieval database database by splitting the queries’ contexts into fixed-sized chunks using Langchain [8] for the database, with Cohere embed-v3.0 [4] embeddings and FAISS [16] L2-distance similarity search in order to re- trieve relevant chunks for RAG inference. To simulate a real RAG workload, we create a mix of queries from each dataset, and send them to METIS using arrival rates that follow a Poisson distribution. We report the results per dataset. Quality Metric: We adopt the following standard metric to measure the generation quality. • F1-score is used to evaluate the METIS’s serving model’s generated response (defined in §2) It is the most widely adopted metric for evaluating RAG QA tasks [10, 69, 72] System Metrics: We adopt the following system metrics: • Delay is used to measure the generation response delay of the model for every RAG query.

We choose this system metric similar to other RAG serving papers [44, 70, 76] • Dollar Cost is used to measure the lower cost of using METIS’s profiler as compared to using larger serving mod- els with fixed configurations having the closest accuracy. Baselines: We compare METIS with the following baselines. • vLLM: We serve RAG with vLLM with multiple static con- figurations across different queries. • Parrot*: We implement Parrot’s [44] configuration-based batching. Parrot* does not adapt the configuration per query. We compare with Parrot* using fixed RAG configu- rations which achieve the closest quality to us. • AdaptiveRAG*: We implement AdaptiveRAG’s [32], query complexity-based RAG-configuration selection and choose the configuration which maximizes the F1-score, without considering the system resource cost. 7.2 Overall improvement Lower delay without sacrificing generation quality: Fig- ure 10 shows METIS achieves delay reduction 1.64 −2.54× over AdaptiveRAG* with no reduction in F1-score. Over us- ing fixed configurations of similar delay, served with both Parrot* and vLLM, METIS achieves 12 −18% higher F1-score. Higher throughput at lower delay: Figure 11 shows METIS achieves higher throughput compared to fixed config- uration baselines when they choose the fixed-config which achieves the closest quality. Compared to Parrot* and vLLM, METIS achieves 1.8 −4.5× times higher throughput. Understanding METIS’ improvement: METIS’s gains come from jointly selecting the configuration based on the available resource, along with performing scheduling. METIS achieves higher quality than the fixed-config baselines as it is adapts the RAG-configuration per query. It reduces delay by resource-aware scheduling, making it better than fixed configurations which achieve closest quality. METIS achieves higher throughput due to being able to adapt configurations based on resource availability as com- pared to the baselines. Both Parrot* and vLLM schedule fixed RAG-configurations and cannot benefit from delay achieved by adapting the configuration like METIS. Parrot* can im- prove the delay over using fixed configurations with vLLM by 1.4 −1.8× but cannot improve the quality. 7.3 Analyzing the gains from METIS Delay saving: Figure 12 shows the contribution of every component of METIS. We compare with vLLM’s fixed config- uration, which achieves the highest quality (blue bar). Using the profiler’s outputs and choosing the median value every time (orange bar), we achieve 1.4 −1.68× reduction in delay. Next, we see the effect of batching (like Parrot*), by choosing the median value configuration and batching, we achieve 1.1 −1.2× reduction in delay.

We see that with the feedback mechanism (blue line), the F1-score improves by 4 −6% as compared to not having feedback (red line) from the outputs of the golden configuration. We ensure that the feedback mechanism can- not result in the output of very expensive configurations, as METIS’ joint scheduler will not pick increasingly expensive configurations based on the GPU resource constraint. 7.4 Sensitivity analysis Changing the inference LLM: Figure 15 shows the out- come of changing the inference LLM to a larger LLM (Llama3.1- 70B) on the Musique and QMSUM datasets. Even with a more powerful LLM, METIS achieves 2.1 −2.4× lower delay than AdaptiveRAG* at a similar F1-score. The best fixed- configuration baselines such as Parrot* and vLLM have a lower F1-score of 7 −10%. In RAG, models mainly rely on the external context to answer the question instead of the model weights and we only get a 2% improvement in F1-score compared to the smaller inference models. Incrementally tuning knobs in METIS: In Figure 16, we show the benefit we the improvement we get by incremen- tally adding more knobs to METIS. We measure this for the QMSUM dataset with the original Mistral-7B-v3 model. We first only tune the num_chunks (red point). Progressively we tune the RAG-configuration knobs of synthesis_method and intermediate_length and scheduling. We achieve 5, 4, 3% higher F1-Score compared to vLLM. Finally, by adding the scheduling, 2.8× lower delay reduction in delay. Changing the profiler LLM: Figure 17 shows the effect of changing the LLM profiler from GPT-4o to a smaller Llama3.1-70B model. METIS with the new profiler, still achieves 1.4 −2.1× over AdaptiveRAG* with a similar F1-score. Static configurations of Parrot* and vLLM which achieve similar delay, METIS achieves 10 −14% higher F1-score. Changing the embedding algorithm: METIS picks a state- of-art retrieval algorithm Cohere-embed-v3.0 [4]. Using two other popular retrieval algorithms All-mpnet-base-v2 [67] and text-embedding-3-large-256 [18], the F1-score change is within 1%. The delay has no measurable difference as the retrieval is > 100× faster than LLM synthesis [6]. Delay overhead of METIS’s per-query profiling: We show the negligible delay overhead of using an LLM profiler within METIS. Figure 18 shows the fraction of METIS’ pro- filer of the total end-to-end delay. Using the profiler at most adds 0.1 fraction and in the average case only adds 0.03−0.06 fraction to the total delay across queries from all datasets. 8", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 474, "sha256": "a939e2012d34d87ac309466557f752ee1be1e304b90b7147d78fb64cc0f6addc"}

METIS can work in conjunction with such systems as METIS focuses on optimizing quality and serving latency, independent of how the retrieval algorithm identifies chunks for retrieval. KV cache storage and retrieval: Storing and reusing KV cache across different requests have been commonly studied in recent work [2, 14, 22, 29, 33, 41, 46, 48, 49, 63, 75, 86, 92]. METIS can work alongside these systems, where instead of retrieving chunks, it can retrieve the KV Caches for generat- ing the output. In RAG, some additional optimizations are needed to combine KV Caches of different chunks that don’t share a common prefix. This is important as the trivial con- catenation of KV Caches loses important cross-attention and reasoning between chunks. These optimizations are enabled by KV Cache blending-based approaches [9, 26, 30, 38, 80, 85]. However RAG workloads have a large number of related contexts across queries and storing all the KV Cache is ex- tremely expensive. We do not measure the KV Cache reuse ratio across queries and leave it for future work. 12 Prefill-Decode Optimizations: Several systems have pro- posed optimizations to speed-up prefill and decode for LLMs by leveraging unique properties of each phase [3, 11, 35, 65, 74, 82, 94, 95]. Notable techniques include chunked-prefill which allows interleaving prefill and decode requests and dis- aggregated prefill which separates compute nodes for prefill and decode. All of these optimizations enable faster genera- tion speed but don’t focus on generation quality. METIS can be applied with such LLM serving systems optimizations. 9 Limitations METIS is currently designed to work with commonly de- ployed RAG pipelines. New research directions in RAG [17, 89] have developed further complex pipelines with more agents and stages for deep chain-of-thought RAG workloads. These pipelines improve on complex workloads but achieve similar performance on all the commonly used RAG QA workloads we consider [1]. We leave METIS’ design exten- sion to chain-of-thought pipelines to future work. 10", "source": "arxiv_pdf", "published": "", "tokens": 360, "sha256": "c380f8272437143b26e7b663f2125f95b79c14c412b1af0073a83a58bddab78a"}
